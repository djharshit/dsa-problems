## Odd Even Linked List

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return _the reordered list_.

The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

##### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^6 <= Node.val <= 10^6`
